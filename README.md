<h3>List of Good coding Practices (In no particular order)</h3>
* Keep class small. Smaller than small. 
* Keep function small. Smaller than small.
* Class should only one thing. So should function. Only one thing.
* Name of function should tell, what it is doing. Any outsider should know what the class might be doing just
by reading its name. Same should apply with name of function.
* Keep meaningfull variable name. Short name is allowed if variable is too local and distance between 
its declaration and last usage is not much. Names like i, j is allowed in for loop etc.
* Keep variable local ()Principle of least access). Always have minimum access to variable and function.
* Have comment. But this is skill and art. The whole purpose should be code should be readable.
This should be achieved by combination of good code(meaningful naming) plus good coding. Avoid 
unnecessary and messy comments.
* DRY: Dont repeat yourself.
* SOLID: In OOPS language like Java.
* Log it. Log it such a way that people just by reading your logs should know that what the code
has done from point A to point B. Log in various levels.
* Fail fast. Throw early exception and error.
* Low coupling and High cohesion.
* Your function should be designed in such a way that it can be tested independently(even using mock).
If not then re-design your function to achieve this.
* Prefer readability over cleverness.
* YAGNI: Delete commented code. Delete whatever you dont need. Delete unused code. Some people may not agree.
